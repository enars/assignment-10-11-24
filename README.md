# Assignment

Hi! I made a basic router-less implementation of the stated requirements without using a context for storing data and styled components for styles. I am strong believer writing tests but setting up my suite of choice with Vite proved nontrivial and would've taken away time from other parts of the assignment. I would be glad to discuss the topic of testing if we meet in person. ðŸ˜Š

In total I have spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
